						Willow is able to jump straight into your hearts! Goldens are medium to large sized animals. The standard size for males range from 23 - 24 inches at the shoulder and weigh proportionally from 65-75 pounds. Females stand around 21.5 - 22.5 inches and weigh 55-65 pounds. They normally possess extremely active tails making clean sweeps of coffee and end tables. Quite simply they need room. Uncluttered houses are a must! Goldens are faithful companions. They are usually always by your side, many will follow you from room to room. They will lie in the kitchen while you cook and at your feet while you watch TV.  If you don't want that much togetherness, a golden isn't for you!  They must be near their humans to be happy.  Be prepared to do a lot of hands on petting with your golden - they love it.  Some goldens are downright needy in their desire for attention from their humans.
